PLACEHOLDER: This file represents a sample Realm file with Schema Version 4.
In a real environment, this would be a binary .realm file generated by the application running version 4.
Tests are currently mocking the schema state, so this file is not directly used but serves as a placeholder for where real migration test files should be placed.
